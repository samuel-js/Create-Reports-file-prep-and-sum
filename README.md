### Creating Reports: Preparing multiple files for report or analisys
An example of how input files can automatically get prepared for analysis or reporting.
There are three files in the repository: two scripts and the final report as a .pdf. Use "Reports: File preparation script" to prepare indivual files and "Reports: File summation script" to create the final .csv.

The script can be almost infinitely tweaked and adapted for diferent needs but this works as a starting point

You can download and run the scrips locally with your own files using Python and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). Note that you also need the libraries Pandas, Numpy and MatPlotLib to run the script. The easiest way to get the enviromments running is to install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/).

The report Print Report 2017-2018 has been created using Google's DataStudio and looks something like this:
